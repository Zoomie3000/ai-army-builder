  // AI Basics (6)
  {
    category: "ai_basics",
    question: "What is an AI agent and how is it different from a chatbot like ChatGPT?",
    answer:
      "A chatbot (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) generates text and answers questions. An AI agent executes actions: it reads screens, clicks buttons, fills forms, calls APIs, and completes workflows end-to-end. Sentus.ai agents combine LLMs with computer vision and orchestration to operate software autonomously under your policies.",
  },
  {
    category: "ai_basics",
    question: "How is Sentus.ai different from traditional RPA?",
    answer:
      "RPA relies on brittle scripts and predefined selectors. Sentus.ai uses perception (computer vision), reasoning (LLMs + planning), and feedback loops to adapt when UIs change. That means faster setup, fewer breaks, and higher ROI with enterprise-grade guardrails.",
  },
  {
    category: "ai_basics",
    question: "Do we need a lot of training data to start?",
    answer:
      "No. You can start with natural-language instructions and a few examples. Agents learn from interactions and your feedback, improving accuracy over time without massive labeled datasets.",
  },
  {
    category: "ai_basics",
    question: "What does \"human-in-the-loop\" mean here?",
    answer:
      "You choose confidence thresholds where humans review or approve actions. Critical steps can require sign-off, while routine steps run autonomously. This balances speed, accuracy, and risk control.",
  },
  {
    category: "ai_basics",
    question: "Can agents work with software that has no API?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Using computer vision and keyboard/mouse control, agents operate any web or desktop app like a skilled user—perfect for legacy or proprietary tools without APIs.",
  },
  {
    category: "ai_basics",
    question: "How do you reduce hallucinations?",
    answer:
      "We combine metacognitive self-checks, tool-use verification, retrieval grounding, and policy constraints. Ambiguities trigger clarification or escalation to humans to maintain reliability.",

    answer:
      "We provide multi-agent orchestration, computer vision for any UI, enterprise security (SOC 2, RBAC, audit logs), and outcome guarantees. Our agents plan, execute, verify, and learn—handling full business processes, not just Q&A.",
  },
  {
    category: "differentiation",
    question: "Can we keep using our preferred LLM and still adopt Sentus.ai?",
    answer:
